		<h1>A little bit of history</h1>
		<p>Pixel Art is an art style that was born directly from technological limitations, the style originated years ago, used in sprites since the earliest video games.
		It can be compared to mosaic art, or perhaps pointillism, which also uses small objects of colour to create a larger image.</p>
		<p>The term was first published in 1982 but was in use for much longer. Due to the graphical technology of the time period, there were severe limits on what graphics could be displayed. 
		Some of the limits that existed were the size of the image, as well as how many colours could be used in the art.</p>
		<p>Nowadays, technology has advanced enough that the idea of graphical limits is far behind us, but pixel art is still a widely used art style as both a nostalgic reference to the past, as well as for it's general aesthetic.</p>
		<br>
		
		<h1>Pixel Art Programs</h1>
		<p>First, you will need a program to actually make art with. Pixel Art is a very accessible style that can be done on many different programs. The most important tool that a program needs for pixel art is a pencil tool that can modify one pixel at a time, as well as an eraser that can also erase one pixel at a time.</p>
		<p>Most art programs support these basic functions so almost anything will work out, though each program has its own pros and cons. These are some suggestions:</p>
		<table>
			<thead>
				<tr>
					<th>Program</th>
					<th>Pros</th>
					<th>Cons</th>
				</tr>
			</thead>
			<tbody>
				<tr>
					<td>Photoshop</td>
					<td>Very versatile program and plugins let you add more features</td>
					<td>Not well suited to creating pixel art, and can be quite costly</td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<td>Gimp</td>
					<td>Free alternative to Photoshop, customizable</td>
					<td>Not as many tools as Photoshop, learning curve</td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<td>MS Paint</td>
					<td>Comes with windows, very simple</td>
					<td>Limited tools, no transparency</td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<td>Aseprite</td>
					<td>Designed completely for pixel art, simple to understand</td>
					<td>Not as customizable as the other choices</td>
				</tr>
			</tbody>
		</table>
		<br>
		<p>I personally use Aseprite and it is what I used for all the art on this website. My suggestion is to try many different art programs and see what is most comfortable to you.</p>

		<h1>How does Pixel Art work?</h1>
		<p>Pixel art is like a magic trick, it tricks your brain into seeing a small jumble of coloured squares as actual images, because your brain likes to use shortcuts.</p>
		<img src="graphics/circle.png" alt="circle">
		<p>As an example, when you see the above picture, you will most likely see it as a circle, but because it is made up of pixels, which are squares, it actually has 116 sides, while a circle only has one side.</p>
		<p>Obviously, the larger the size of the image, the more pixels it would have, and it is common sense that at some point it is no longer considered pixel art and is just a normal image.</p>
		<p>The opposite can be said as the image size gets smaller, in which case it becomes clearer that the image is made up of smaller pixels and it becomes more difficult to make it appear as a proper image to viewers.</p>
